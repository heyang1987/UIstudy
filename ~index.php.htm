            <h4><strong>Description of the Study and Your Part in It</strong></h4>
            <p>Dr. Bart Knijnenburg invites you to take part in a research study. Dr. Knijnenburg is a professor at Clemson University. 
            This is a survey about the use of various smart devices/gadgets in a Household IoT environment. IoT stands for Internet of Things;
            this study is about household appliances such as TVs and refrigerators that are connected to the Internet and contain software and sensors that make them "smart". The survey is about managing the basic data generated by these devices.</p>
            <p>Your part in the study will be to complete a questionnaire. You will be presented with an IoT privacy-setting user interface, and asked to answer a few simple questions about that user interface.</p>
            <p>It will take you about 15-20 minutes to be in this study.</p>
            <h4><strong>Risks and Discomforts</strong></h4>
            <p>We do not know of any risks or discomforts to you in this research study. 
               However, if you feel that you need a break, then you may take one at any time. 
               You may also opt out of the study at any time if you are not comfortable.</p>
            <h4><strong>Possible Benefits</strong></h4>
            <p>We do not know of any way you would benefit directly from taking part in this study. However, this research may help us to understand how we can improve the household IoT experience.</p>
            <h4><strong>Incentives</strong></h4>
            <p>As a result of your completion of this study, we will compensate you $1.50 through Amazon Mechanical Turk. We ask that you only participate in this study once, as each person will only be compensated once for their participation.</p>
            <p>This survey contains attention-checking items to make sure that you are reading all questions carefully. If you do not answer these items correctly, we will not be able to use your data, and you may be asked to return the HIT without compensation.</p>
            <p>We appreciate your participation and feedback from this study.</p>
            <h4><strong>Protection of Privacy and Confidentiality</strong></h4>
            <p>We will do everything we can to protect your privacy and confidentiality. We will not collect any identifiable information that could be linked back to you. Everything will be stored securely and anonymously. Our system will generate anonymous IDs for those who participate in this study.</p>
            <h4><strong>Choosing to Be in the Study</strong></h4>
            <p>You do not have to be in this study. You may choose not to take part, and you may choose to stop taking part at any time. You will not be punished in any way if you decide not to be in the study or to stop taking part in the study.</p>
