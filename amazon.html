<p style="color: red"><strong>Eligibility - READ THIS FIRST:&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Please note that you may only participate in this study&nbsp;<strong>once</strong>. Previous participants in this study are not eligible to participate again.</p>

<p>When you participate, please&nbsp;<strong>carefully</strong>&nbsp;perform every task and read each question before you provide your answers.
We are&nbsp;<strong>not</strong>&nbsp;able to pay workers who just click through the system without paying attention to what they are doing.
We give you plenty of time until the HIT expires, so feel free to&nbsp;<strong>have fun and take it easy</strong>.</p>

<p></p>If you carefully answer each question, we will approve the HIT as quickly as possible, typically within 2-3 days (sorry that we can't do it quicker... manual checks take time!).</p>
